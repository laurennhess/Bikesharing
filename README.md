# Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview 
In New York City, there is a bikesharing company that allows people to rent bikes using an app on their phone. The app calculates the ride and charges the customer for the trip. After testing out NYC Citi Bike, a friend and I wanted to see if it would be a good investment to start a bike share company in De Moines, Iowa. De Moines is much smaller compared to NYC, so we wanted to analyze whether or not this idea would survive in a smaller toursim town.

To complete our analysis, we pulled the NYC Citi Bike dataset for the month of August, a month that is popular for tourists to visit NYC. Using pandas, we changed the "trip duration" column to a datetime datatype and then began visualizing our data using Tableau. 

Using Tableau to create visualizations based on the data we gathered from NYC Citi Bike, we came up with a business propsal to present to potential investors. The story that we show in Tableau will outline whether or not the bikesharing company will survive in De Moine, Iowa, using interactive dashboards set with specific and thought out parameters. 

## Results
### 1. Popular Checkout Times for Users
This dashboard shows poular check out times for city bikes as well as trip duration in minutes during each hour the bikes are checked out. Based on the filter we applied on Trip Duration, we can see that "rush hour" for using the city bikes is between 6am - 8am and then again at 5pm - 7pm. These "rush hours" can be correlated to the standard commute and work hours during the work week.
